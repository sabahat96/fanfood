                                <ol>
                                    <li>In consideration of payment of the fees as set out below or on the applicable Order Form, during the Term of this Agreement, FanFood grants Customer a restricted, limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, subscription to use the FanFood Product. Except as expressly provided herein, this Agreement does not grant Customer any rights to, or in, patents, copyrights, database rights, trade secrets, trade names, trademarks (whether registered or unregistered), or any other rights or licenses with respect to the FanFood Product. Customer further agrees that it will not: (a) attempt to copy, modify, duplicate, create derivative works from, mirror, republish, download, display, transmit, distribute, or in any way emulate all or any portion of the FanFood Product in any form or media or by any means; (b) attempt to reverse compile, disassemble, reverse engineer or otherwise reduce to human-perceivable form all or any part of any computer code used by FanFood to provide the FanFood Product; (c) access all or any part of any website, software, source code or computer code used by FanFood to provide the FanFood Product in order to build a product or service that competes with the Services; or (d) use or allow the transmission, transfer, export, re-export or other transfer of any Services, Software, or technology or information it obtains or learns pursuant to this Agreement.</li>
                                    <li>To the extent provided for in an Order Form, Customer may purchase the FanFood Product to be used by third-party beneficiaries of Customer (such party, the “Third-Party Customer”). To the extent such contractual relationship is contemplated, Customer shall clearly provide for such use of the FanFood Product in the applicable Order Form and each Third-Party Customer shall enter into a separate agreement provided by FanFood and to be subject to these Terms or such other terms required by FanFood to use the FanFood Product.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Expedited Services.</b> Neither FanFood nor its affiliates provide expedited provisioning, delivery, or logistics services. Customer acknowledges and agrees that any delivery services or other expedited provisioning, delivery, or logistics services Customer desires to offer shall be Customer’s sole responsibility.</li>
                            <li><b>Fees and Billing </b>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><b>FanFood Product Fees; Invoicing.</b> The fees for the FanFood Product are stated in each applicable Order Form, subject also to the terms below. Unless provided otherwise in an Order Form, FanFood shall provide Customer or the Third-Party Customer with an invoice detailing relevant fees due in connection with this Agreement on a monthly basis. To the extent any fees and expenses are “netted” by FanFood in a given month pursuant to Section 4.2 hereof, such netted amounts will be reflected on the invoice related to such month and counted towards any fees charged for such month. Unless provided otherwise in an Order Form, all fees reflected in any invoice that are not covered by amounts netted pursuant to Section 4.2 are due and owing either in advance for the applicable month of service or within fifteen (15) days of Company sending such invoice to Customer or Third-Party.  Customer shall pay interest computed at the rate equal to the higher of (i) one and one-half percent (1 1/2%) per month or (ii) the maximum rate permitted by law, on any amounts due hereunder that are remitted more than thirty (30) days late. Customer shall be responsible for all costs and expenses, including court costs and attorneys fees, incurred by Company in collecting any fees owed to it under this Section 4 or enforcing any of its rights under this Agreement.  Failure to pay invoices and amounts owing when due is a material breach of this Agreement. </li>
                                    <li><b>Billing.</b> As part of the FanFood Product process and as further provided in the Order Form, FanFood shall process (or use third-parties to process) the payments of third-parties ordering product from the Customer. FanFood shall have the right to “net” or take all fees and expenses owing to FanFood from Customer from those amounts collected from third-party customers before or as part of the transaction to provide those amounts to Customer. All revenues owed by FanFood back to Customer will either be automatically deposited into Customer’s bank account within 14 business days or sooner if mutually agreed upon of each event or sent a check at the end of each month totaling all event remittance for that month. The terms of such “netting” may be further provided for in the applicable Order Form.</li>
                                    <li><b>Service Fee(s).</b>  In consideration for use of the FanFood Product, FanFood may charge Customer a service fee for each item or transaction provided via the FanFood Product ("Service Fee"). The Service Fee is net of any taxes for which Customer is liable. The Service Fee is the Retail Price of all product sold by Customer via the FanFood Product (excluding any sales tax collected on Customer’s behalf) multiplied by the applicable Service Fee. FanFood will remit to Customer the total Retail Price collected for all product sold by Customer via the Product plus the taxes collected on Customer’s behalf via the Marketplace less the retained Service Fee, Payment Processing, and any refunds given to Customer’s customers (such remitted amount, the "FanFood Revenue") (remittance will be within 14 days of items being sold or sooner if mutually-agreed upon). All fees under this Agreement shall be paid in U.S. Dollars. If agreed and/or provided in the Order Form, Customer may also be charged an Activation Fee for FanFood to activate Customer on the FanFood Product and/or a Promotional Fee in consideration of the enhanced promotion Customer receive by selling Customer’s items on the FanFood Product. FanFood will give Customer aggregate information regarding the number of items picked up and provided by Customer to Customer’s customers (including the date, and for Marketplace only, specific items and reason given for any refund (if any)), all subject to applicable privacy laws.</li>
                                    <li><b>Taxes.</b> Customer is responsible for determining and setting the retail price ("Retail Price") for each item to be made available via the FanFood Product, but Customer agrees that Customer will not set a Retail Price higher than the amount Customer is charging for similar products in store. Customer is the "retailer" or "seller" of all items made available in the FanFood Product for local and state sales tax purposes and the responsible party for collection and remittance of applicable sales tax. The Retail Price for each product sold through the FanFood Product will not include sales tax, but Customer is solely responsible for determining all applicable sales tax and identifying and informing FanFood of the appropriate sales tax amount to be charged on Customer’s behalf for items sold via the FanFood Product. </b></li>
                                    <li><b>Payment Processing.</b> FanFood currently uses a third-party Company, Stripe, to process payments. Such process fees will be provided for in the applicable Order Form. The payment processing fee is deducted from the gross sales and configured prior to either payment being sent to Customer’s designed bank account through FanFood Product or Check by mail.</li>
                                    <li><b>4.6. Additional Fees.</b> Additional fees and charges for the FanFood Product may be provided on the Order Form.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li><b>On boarding & Training.</b> FanFood will provide to Customer on boarding training as provided in the Order Form. Additional training may be added by mutual agreement between the Parties or as provided in the Order Form.</li>
                            <li><b>FanFood Product Support.</b> FanFood agrees to provide technical support to Customer for the FanFood Product. FanFood will offer Customer a dedicated email address for which to send inquiries. From time to time, FanFood may perform scheduled and/or unscheduled maintenance to correct, modify, or enhance the FanFood Product. During such maintenance, all or selected portions of the FanFood Product may be unavailable. FanFood will notify Customer of any scheduled maintenance and work in good faith to ensure the FanFood Product is available. FanFood will not be held liable for any downtime of the FanFood Product. All corrections, modifications, enhancements, or updates to the FanFood Product will be governed by the terms of this Agreement.</li>
                            <li><b>End User Support.</b> “End Users” are those individuals or entities using the Customer’s website and interacting with Customer through the Software provided by FanFood to Customer. Unless specifically provided otherwise in the Order Form, Customer will be responsible for providing first-level support for all initial End User inquiries and for escalating any necessary matters to the designated FanFood Account Manager (“FanFood Account Manager”). During the implementation process, Customer will designate a single point of contact, which will be a named representative of Customer to facilitate any necessary support escalation with the FanFood Account Manager. </li>
                            <li><b>Term and Renewal.</b> Unless provided otherwise on the Order Form, this Agreement and each Order Form will have a one year term (the “Initial Term”). Unless a Party gives written notice to the other Party of its decision not to renew the Agreement at least ninety (90) days prior to the end of any Term, after the Initial Term the Agreement will automatically renew for additional one-year terms (each a “Renewal Term”) until terminated in accordance with the terms herein (the Initial Term and each Renewal Term may be collectively referred to as the “Term”): 
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Either Party may terminate this Agreement if the other Party breaches its obligations under this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days prior written notice to such other Party describing the breach, provided however, that Customer’s failure to timely pay any undisputed amounts to FanFood shall only require a fifteen (15) day notice and cure period.</li>
                                    <li>FanFood may terminate immediately this Agreement if Customer commits an un-curable material breach, which includes an abuse of the FanFood Product in any manner prohibited by this Agreement or any of FanFoods privacy policy or terms of use. </li>
                                    <li>Either Party may terminate this Agreement, immediately, as a result of the other Party being subject to insolvency, liquidation, winding up, bankruptcy or similar proceedings, or if such other Party is unable to reasonably uphold its monetary obligations to creditors. </li>
                                    <li>Immediately upon any termination or expiration of this Agreement, FanFood may terminate the Services provided to Customer and all fees incurred up to the date of termination or expiration and owed to FanFood will become immediately due. Customer will return all Proprietary Information (defined below) to FanFood. Sections 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 will survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement. </li>
